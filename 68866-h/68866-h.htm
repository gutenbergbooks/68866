<hr class="r5" />
<p>This little work is intended to furnish the <span class="smcap">Practical House-Painter—the
Every-day Workman</span>—with information sufficient to
enable him to understand his business intelligently. One of its
objects is to deal with the nature, characteristics, qualities, and
defects of the materials employed by the class of artisans for whom
it is written; and to a limited extent this has been done with as
little theory as possible; high-sounding technicalities have also
been avoided wherever the author has been able to make himself
understood without them.</p>

<p>It is thought the young painter may derive great profit and
advancement from a careful study of this book, as the hints, rules,
and recipes it contains are reliable, practical, and of every-day use.</p>

<p>The author has consulted many works on the subject, and is
indebted to many of them for much of the matter contained, among
which may be mentioned “Building Construction and Materials,”
“House-Painter’s Hand-Book,” “Artists’ and Tradesmen’s Companion,”
“Painter’s Guide,” “Chevreul’s Oils and Paints,” and
several other works of more or less note. To this has been added
many things discovered by the actual experience of the writer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HINTS_FOR_PAINTERS">HINTS FOR PAINTERS
AND PAPER-HANGERS.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />
<p>There is a general belief abroad that anybody can execute
all that is required of a house-painter. This is a very popular
error; it is not so easy to prepare and apply a coat of paint
in a thorough workmanlike manner as some may imagine.
It is still less easy to paint in parti colors; and very few can
produce a good piece of graining.</p>

<p>The painter should not only be acquainted with the
method of applying paint when it is provided for him, and
the brush placed in his hand, but he should know the composition
of the colors; the manner in which they are made,
and the colors which must harmonize with each other when
they are associated together. These observations being of a
practical nature and the result of experience, are commended
for his perusal and study.</p>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>—All surfaces painted should be first
thoroughly dry and free from dust. All heads of nails should
be punched or “set” below the surface of the wood, and
after the priming is dry, the holes formed by the heads, as
well as all cracks, defects, etc., should be filled up with putty
made of raw linseed oil and whiting. To prevent knots or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
“fat” spots from showing through, they should receive two
coats of shellac varnish, and when dry rubbed down with
sand-paper. The shellac should be applied with a small
brush. It dries soon and may be painted over as soon as
dry. Shellac prepared this way is called “knotting,” and
can be purchased wherever painters’ materials are kept for
sale.</p>

<p><b>Materials.</b>—The principal materials used for painting,
<i>i.e.</i>, white lead and oxide of zinc, are so well known that it is
unnecessary to allude particularly to their manufacture at
present. Before using them they should be mixed with pure
raw linseed oil. Turpentine may be used in cold weather to
make the paint work easy, as the oil is apt to chill, which
thickens it and makes it difficult to apply. In warm weather,
however, turpentine should not be used in priming any parts
where the sun shines upon. In cold weather it is always
necessary to use litharge or some other drier; or the work
will remain a long time before it hardens; in summer, however,
driers in most cases are unnecessary, for if the wood to
be painted is as well seasoned as it ought to be there is little
danger of the paint being washed off by rain, as it will mostly
be absorbed in the surface.</p>

<p>To make satisfactory work it is imperative that all cans,
pots and brushes used in painting be perfectly clean at the
start, and kept so whenever the conditions will permit. A
marble slab and muller will be required to grind the finer
colors used. Sometimes a small cast-iron mill will be found
useful not only to grind colors; but to pass the tinted color
through, so that it may be thoroughly mixed. It is scarcely
necessary to say that it is presumed the workman will know
what brushes he will require according to the work he has in
hand. His large ground paint brush, called a “pound-brush;”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
his half-size, for smaller work; his fitch and sash
tools, duster, pallet, putty and hasp knives; oval and flat
varnish brushes, varnish-pot, step-ladders and long ladders,
mahl-stick, pallet-board, gilding-knife, camel and sable hair-pencils,
whitewash brushes, jack for window work, cushion,
tip-pole, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Large brushes, such as 6-0 size, should be bridled when
new by winding good twine around them about one-third up
the length of the bristles, and as the brush wears, this binding
can be unwound. Care should be taken to use the brushes
so that they will have a flat wedge-shaped point, straight on
the edge. This can be done by holding the brush always in
one position. If brushes are turned round and round in the
hand while in use, they wear round and stubby on the point
and soon become useless for fine or smooth work.</p>

<p>Brushes that are in use every day should be placed in water
half the depth of the bristles at night, taking care that brushes
containing different colors do not come in contact with one
another. If they are to be laid aside for any length of time,
however, they should be washed with warm water and soap
after being thoroughly cleansed with turpentine, and laid
away in a moist place.</p>

<p>As a general thing it is better to buy putty already made
at a regular paint store, where you may depend upon its being
made of good whiting and linseed oil than to make it. Putty
should not be used until the work has been primed, for new
paint holds the putty very firmly.</p>

<p>White lead is to be judged of by being well ground and
possessing the mellowness given to it by age.</p>

<p>It is well known amongst painters that the best article is
the most economical, as it works out with more ease, and
repays the difference of cost in its better appearance and
extra durability. Linseed oil is also better for having due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
age, for the same reasons as the white lead, working with
softness and advantage after parting with the water, which is
generally combined with new oil.</p>

<p>In most cases <i>driers</i> are added to paints to cause them to
dry more quickly, and a <i>solvent</i> is sometimes required to make
the paints work more freely. When the color required differs
from that of the main paint used, the desired tint is obtained
by adding a staining or coloring pigment. The materials
generally employed may, for convenience, be classed as
follows:</p>

<p><b>Bases.</b>—White lead, red lead, zinc white, oxide of iron.
<i>Vehicles.</i>—Oils, spirits of turpentine. <i>Solvents.</i>—Spirits of
turpentine. <i>Driers.</i>—Litharge, acetate of lead, sulphate of
zinc and binoxide of manganese, red lead, etc. <i>Coloring
Pigments.</i>—Ochres, lampblack, umber, sienna, and many
metallic salts that will be hereinafter mentioned.</p>

<p>White lead may be obtained either pure or mixed with
various substances, such as sulphate of baryta, sulphate of
lead, whiting, chalk, zinc white, etc. These substances do
not combine with oil as well as does white lead, nor do they
so well protect any surface to which they are applied. Sulphate
of baryta, the most common adulterant, is a dense,
heavy, white substance, very like white lead in appearance.
It absorbs very little oil, and may frequently be detected by
the gritty feeling it produces when the paint is rubbed between
the finger and thumb.</p>

<p><b>White Lead</b> is sold either dry, in powder or lump,
or else ground in oil in a paste containing from 7 to 9
per cent. of linseed oil, and more or less adulterated,
unless specially marked “genuine.” When slightly adulterated
with a very white sulphate of baryta, like that of
the Tyrol, the mixture is considered preferable for certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
kinds of work, as the barytes communicates opacity to
the color and protects the lead from being speedily darkened
by sulphurous smoke or vapors. White lead improves
by keeping, and when of good quality, will go much further
and last much better than when employed fresh; moreover,
paint made with new lead has a tendency to become yellow.
It should not be exposed to the air or it will turn grey.</p>

<p>Of all the bases used for paints, white lead is the most
commonly used, and for surfaces of wood it affords in most
cases the best protection, being dense, of good body, and
permanent. It has the disadvantage, however, of blazening
when exposed to sulphur acids, and of being injurious to
those who handle it.</p>

<p>Red lead is produced by raising <i>massicot</i> (the commercial
name for oxide of lead) to a high temperature, short of fusion,
during which it absorbs oxygen from the air and is converted
into red lead or <i>minium</i>, an oxide of lead. The color is lasting,
and is unaffected by light when it is pure and used alone,
but any preparation containing lead or acids mixed with it
deprive it of color, and impure air makes it black. It may
be used for a drier, as it possesses many of the properties of
litharge; it is also often employed in painting wrought iron
work, to which it adheres with a tenacity not equalled by
any other paints; it is sometimes objected to for this purpose,
on the ground that galvanic action is set up between the lead
and the iron. It is also frequently used for priming on wood
work, and is especially adapted for hard woods. It is frequently
adulterated with brick dust; this may be detected by
heating the powder in a crucible, and treating it with dilute
nitric acid; the lead will be dissolved but the brick dust will
remain. It is also adulterated with colcother, a sesquioxide
of iron. Sulphide of antimony, or antimony vermilion, is
sometimes used as a substitute for red lead. It is sold in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
very fine powder, without taste or smell, and which is insoluble
in water, alcohol, or essential oils. It is but little acted
upon by acids, and is said to be unaffected by air or light.
It is adapted for mixing with white lead, and affords an intensely
bright color when ground in oil.</p>

<p>Oxide of zinc, or zinc white, is durable in water or oil; it
dissolves in hydrochloric acid; it does not blacken in the
presence of sulphuretted hydrogen; and it is not injurious to
the men who make it, or to the painters who use it; but on
the other hand, it does not combine with oil well, and is
wanting in body and covering power, and is difficult to work.
It is easily acted upon by the carbonic acid in rain water,
which dissolves the oxide, and it therefore is unfit for outside
work. The acids contained in unseasoned wood also have a
great effect upon it. When pure and used for inside work,
it retains its color well, and will stand washing for many years
without losing any of its freshness. When dry it becomes
very hard, and will take a fine polish. This paint is suitable
for any place that is subjected to vapors containing sulphur,
or in places where foul air is emanated from decaying animal
matter. In such positions, of course, zinc paints should not
be mixed with “patent” or other driers which contain lead.
The best driers to employ with it are sulphate of manganese
and sulphate of zinc. This white is recommended as being
preferable to white lead for painting on a dark ground. The
reason of this is that the soap formed by the combination of
the lead and oil in lead paints is semi-transparent, and the
dark ground shows through it. The want of density, however,
in zinc paints, is a great drawback to their use, and the
purest zinc oxide is not always the best for paint on account
of its low specific gravity; and in this respect, the American
zinc whites, which are frequently very pure, do not generally
give as good satisfaction as the zinc whites made in Belgium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p><b>Vehicles.</b>—Oils are divided into two classes—fixed oils
and volatile oils. Fixed oils are extracted by pressure from
vegetable substances, they are of a fatty nature, do not
evaporate in drying, and will bear a temperature short of 500°
Fahr., without decomposing. They are subdivided into drying
oils, which become thick upon exposure to air. Of these,
linseed oil is most commonly used as an ingredient for paint.
Its qualities when pure are excellent, and it may be considered
the best of all oils for use in paint, putty, and other
similar substances. It oxidizes and becomes thick upon exposure
to the air. This property is very much increased by
adding other substances to it and boiling them together. It
is superior in drying powers, tenacity, and body to any other
fixed oil. The best oil comes from the Black Sea and the
Baltic; that from the East Indian seed is inferior, as the seed
is less carefully cleaned, and contains too much stearine.
Raw linseed oil is clear and light in color, works smoothly,
and is used for internal works, for delicate tints, and for grinding
up colors. Boiled oil is much thicker, darker, and more
apt to clog. It is used for outside work, as its greater body
and rapidity in drying make it a quicker and more efficient
protection.</p>

<p><b>Volatile Oils</b> are generally obtained by distillation, and
have an odor resembling that of the plant from which they
are obtained. They are, as a rule, colorless at first, but upon
exposure to air and light they become darker, thicker, and
eventually are converted into a kind of resin. Spirits of turpentine
is the best variety of this class for mixing with ordinary
paints. Naptha and benzine are sometimes used instead
of turpentine, but not often, and their use is not recommended
when the latter can be obtained. Good spirits of turpentine
is lighter in weight and more inflammable than bad. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
colorless and has a pleasant pungent smell, whereas the smell
of inferior qualities is disagreeable. It is used as a solvent
for resins and other substances in making varnishes; also in
paint to make it work more smoothly. It is useful also in
flatting coats, but will not stand exposure to the weather.</p>

<p><b>Driers.</b>—Driers are substances added to paint in order
to cause the oils to thicken and solidify more rapidly. The
action of these substances is not thoroughly understood.
Chevreuil has shown that the drying of linseed oil is caused
by the absorption of oxygen; and there can be no doubt that
for the most part driers act as carriers of oxygen to the oil, a
very small quantity producing considerable effects.</p>

<p>The best driers are those which contain a large proportion
of oxygen, such as litharge, acetate of lead, red lead, sulphate
of zinc, verdigris, etc. They are sometimes used to improve
the drying qualities of the oil with which the paint is mixed,
or they may themselves be ground up with a small quantity
of oil, and added to the paint just before it is used.</p>

<p>Litharge or oxide of lead is the drier most commonly used,
and is produced in extracting lead from its ores. It can be
produced on a small scale by scraping off the dross which
forms on molten lead exposed to a current of air. <i>Massicot</i>
is a superior kind of litharge, being produced by heating lead
to an extent insufficient to fuse the oxide. Sugar of lead, or,
as it is more frequently called, acetate of lead, ground in oil,
and copperas and white vitriol (sulphate of zinc), are also
used as driers, especially for light tints. Oxide of manganese
is quicker in its effects, but is of a very dark color, and seldom
used except for deep tints. Japanners’ gold size and verdigris
(acetate of copper) are also much used for dark colors.
Care must be taken not to apply too much of the size, or it
will make the paint brittle. Red lead (oxide of lead) is often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
used as a drier when its color will not interfere with the tint
required. It is not so rapid in its action as litharge or
massicot. Sulphate of manganese is the best drier for zinc
white, about 6 or 8 ounces only being used for 100 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, of
ground zinc white paint. The manganese should be mixed
with a small quantity of the paint first, and then added to the
bulk. If great care be not taken in mixing the drier the work
will be spotted. Sulphate of zinc is also a good drier for zinc
paint.</p>

<p>Patent driers contain oxidizing agents, such as litharge or
acetate of lead ground and mixed in oil, and therefore in a
convenient form for immediate use. There is great danger,
however, in using such driers, unless they are of the best
quality from a reliable maker. Some of the inferior descriptions
depend for their drying qualities upon lime.</p>

<p>The following points should be observed in using driers:—</p>

<p>1st. Not to use them unnecessarily with pigments which
dry well in oil color.</p>

<p>2d. Not to employ them in excess, which would only retard
the drying.</p>

<p>3d. Not to add them to the color until about to be used.</p>

<p>4th. Not to use more than one drier to the same color.</p>

<p>5th. To avoid the use of patent driers, unless known to be
of good quality.</p>

<p>6th. To avoid the use of driers in the finishing coat of light
colors, as they are liable to injure the color.</p>

<p><b>Coloring Pigments.</b>—It will be impossible in a small
work of this sort to give anything like a complete list of the
pigments used to produce the colors and tints used by the
house painter and decorator. A few of the most useful may,
however, be mentioned. It is not proposed to give a detailed
description of them, but merely to distinguish those that are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
injurious from the others. Many of these, such as the ochres,
umbers, etc., are from natural earths; others are artificially
made. They may generally be purchased either in the form
of dry powder or ground in oil.</p>

<p><b>Blacks.</b>—Lampblack is the soot produced by burning oil,
resin, small coal, resinous woods, coal tar or tallow. It is in
the state of very fine powder; works smoothly; is of a dense
black color and durable, but dries very slowly in oil.</p>

<p>Vegetable black is a better kind of lampblack made from
oil. It is very light, free from grit, and of a good color. It
should be used with boiled oil, driers, and a little varnish.
Raw linseed oil or spirits of turpentine keeps it from drying.</p>

<p>Ivory-black is obtained by calcining waste ivory in close
vessels and then grinding. It is intensely black when properly
burned. Bone-black is inferior to ivory-black, and prepared
in a similar manner from bones. Blue-black and
Frankfort black of the best quality are made from vine twigs;
inferior qualities from other woods charred and reduced to
powder. In Europe some other blacks are used, but we
seldom meet with them in this country.</p>

<p><b>Blues.</b>—Prussian blue is made by mixing prussiate of
potash with a salt of iron. The prussiate of potash is obtained
by calcining and digesting old leather, blood, hoofs, or other
animal matter with carbonate of potash and iron filings.
This color is much used, especially for dark blues, making
purples, and intensifying black. It dries well with oil.
Slight differences in the manufacture cause considerable variation
in tint and color, which leads to the material being
known by different names—such as Antwerp blue, Berlin
blue, Hærlem blue, Chinese blue, etc. Indigo is produced
by steeping certain plants in water, and allowing them to
ferment. It is a transparent color; works well in oil or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
water, but is not durable, especially when mixed with white
lead.</p>

<p>Ultramarine was originally made by grinding the valuable
mineral <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lapis lazuli</i>. Genuine ultramarine so made is very
expensive, but artificial French and German ultramarines are
made of better color, and cheaply, by fusing and washing
and reheating a mixture of soda, silica, alum, and sulphur.
This blue is chiefly used for coloring wall papers.</p>

<p>Cobalt blue is an oxide of cobalt made by roasting cobalt
ore. It makes a beautiful color, and works well in water or
oil.</p>

<p>Smalt, Saxon blue and Royal blue are colored by oxides
of cobalt.</p>

<p>There are a few other blues, such as Celestial or Brunswick
blue, damp blue and verditer, that are chemical compounds,
compounds of alum, copper, lime, and other substances; but
they are so seldom used in this country that it is unnecessary
to describe them in detail.</p>

<p><b>Yellows.</b>—Chrome yellows are chromates of lead, produced
by mixing dilute solutions of acetate or nitrate of lead
and bichromate of potash. This makes a medium tint known
as “middle chrome.” The addition of sulphate of lead makes
this paler, when it is known as “lemon chrome,” whereas the
addition of caustic lime makes it “orange chrome” of a
darker color. The chromes mix well with oil and with white
lead either in oil or water. They stand the sun well, but like
other lead salts, become dark in bad air. Chrome yellow is
frequently adulterated with gypsum.</p>

<p>Naples yellow is a salt of lead and antimony, supposed to
have been originally made from a natural volcanic product at
Naples. It is not so brilliant as chrome, but has the same
characteristics. King’s yellow is made from arsenic, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
therefore a dangerous color to handle, or use for internal
work. It is not durable, and it injures several other colors
when mixed with them. Chinese yellow, arsenic yellow, and
yellow orpiment are other names for this yellow.</p>

<p>Yellow ochre is a natural clay colored by oxide of iron,
and found abundantly in many parts of the world. It is not
very brilliant, but is well suited for distemper work, as it is
not affected by light or air. It does not lose its color when
mixed with lime washes as many other colors do. There
are several varieties of ochres, all having the same characteristics
differing only in color which varies from a golden to a
dark brown.</p>

<p><b>Terra De Sienna</b>, or raw Sienna, is a clay, stained with
oxides of iron and manganese, and of a dull yellow color. It
is durable both in oil and water, and is useful in all work,
especially in graining.</p>

<p><b>Browns.</b>—Browns generally owe their color to oxide of
iron. Raw umber is a clay similar to ochre colored by oxide
of iron. The best comes from Turkey; it is very durable
both in water and in oil; does not injure other colors when
mixed with them.</p>

<p><b>Burnt Umber</b> is the last mentioned material burnt to
give it a darker color. It is useful as a drier, and in mixing
with white lead to make a stone color.</p>

<p><b>Vandyke Brown.</b>—This color is an earthy dark brown
mineral; it is durable both in oil and water, and is frequently
employed in graining.</p>

<p><b>Purple Brown</b> is of a reddish-brown color. It should
be used with boiled oil—and a little varnish and driers for
outside work.</p>

<p><b>Burnt Sienna</b> is produced by burning raw sienna. It
is the best color for shading gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p><b>Brown Pink</b> is a vegetable color often of a greenish hue.
It works well in water and oil, but dries badly, and will not
keep its color when mixed with white lead. Spanish brown
and brown ochre are clays colored naturally by various oxides.</p>

<p><b>Reds.</b>—Carmine, made from the cochineal insect, is the
most brilliant red color known. It is, however, too expensive
for ordinary house painting, and is not durable. It is sometimes
used for inside decoration.</p>

<p><b>Red Lead.</b>—This color has already been described on
<a href="#Page_11">page 11</a>.</p>

<p><b>Vermilion.</b>—This is a sulphide of mercury in a natural
state as cinnabar. The best comes from China. Artificial
vermilion is also made both in China and in this country
from a mixture of sulphur and mercury. Genuine vermilion
is very durable, but when mixed with red lead, as it is sometimes,
it will not stand the weather. It can be tested by
heating in a test tube; if genuine it will entirely volatilize.
German vermilion is the tersulphide of antimony, and is of
an orange-red color.</p>

<p><b>Indian Red.</b>—This color is a ground hematite ore
brought from Bengal; it is sometimes made artificially by calcining
sulphate of iron. The tints vary, but a rosy hue is considered
the best. It may be used with turpentine and a little
varnish to produce a dull surface, drying rapidly, or with boiled
oil and a little driers, in which case a glossy surface will be
produced, drying more slowly.</p>

<p><b>Chinese Red</b> and Persian red are chromates of lead,
produced by boiling white lead with a solution of bichromate
of potash. The tint of Persian red is obtained by the employment
of sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><b>Venetian Red</b> is obtained by heating sulphate of iron
produced as a waste product at tin and copper works. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
is often adulterated by mixing sulphate of lime with it during
the manufacture. When pure, it is often called “bright red.”
Special tints of purple and brown are frequently required,
which greatly enhance the value of the material. These
tints should be obtained in the process of manufacture, and
not produced by mixing together a variety of different shades
of color. When the tint desired is attempted to be obtained
by this latter course it is never so good, and the materials
produced are known in the trade as ‘faced colors,’ and are
of inferior value.</p>

<p><b>Rose Pink.</b>—This is made of a sort of chalk or whiting
stained with a tincture of Brazil wood. It fades very quickly,
but it is used for paperhangings, common distemper, and for
staining cheap furniture.</p>

<p><b>Lakes.</b>—These are made by precipitating colored vegetable
tinctures by means of alum and carbonate of potash.
The alumina combines with the organic coloring matter and
separates it from the solution. The tincture used varies in
the different descriptions of lake. The best, made from
cochineal or madder, is used for internal work. Drop
lake is made by dropping a mixture of Brazil wood through
a funnel on to a slab. The drops are dried and mixed into
a paste with gum water. It is sometimes called “Brazil wood
lake.” Scarlet lake is made from cochineal; so also are
Florentine lake, Hamburg lake, Chinese lake, Roman lake,
Venetian lake and Carminated lake.</p>

<p><b>Orange.</b>—Chrome orange is a chromate of lead, brighter
than vermillion, but less durable. Orange ochre is a bright
yellow ochre burnt to give it warmth of tint; it dries and
works well in water or oil, and is very durable. It is known
also as Spanish ochre. Orange red is produced by a further
oxidation than is required for red lead. It is a brighter and
better color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p><b>Greens.</b>—These, of course, may be made by mixing blue
and yellow together, but such mixtures are less durable than
those produced direct from copper, arsenic, etc. The latter
are, however, objectionable for use in distemper or on wall
papers, as they are very injurious to health. Brunswick
green of the best kind is made by treating copper with
sal-ammoniac. Chalk, lead and alum are sometimes added.
It has rather a bluish tinge; dries well in oil, is durable, and
not poisonous. Common Brunswick green is made by mixing
chromate of lead and Prussian blue with sulphate of
baryta. It is not as durable as real Brunswick green.
Mineral green is made from bi-basic carbonate of copper; it
weathers well. Verdigris is acetate of copper. It furnishes
a bluish-green color, durable in oil or varnish, but not in
water; it dries rapidly, but requires great care in using owing
to its poisonous qualities. Green verditer is a carbonate of
copper and lime; is not very durable. Prussian green is
made by mixing different substances with Prussian blue.
There are a number of other greens made from copper, but
they all possess in a greater or lesser degree, the same qualities
as the foregoing. Emerald or Paris green is made of
verdigris mixed with a solution of arsenious acid. It is of a
very brilliant color, but is very poisonous; is difficult to grind,
and dries badly in oil. It should be purchased ready ground
in oil, as in that case the poisonous particles do not fly about,
and the difficulty of grinding is avoided. Scheele’s green and
Vienna green are also arseniates of copper, and highly poisonous.
Chrome green should be made from the oxide of
chromium, and is very durable. An inferior chrome green
is made, however, by mixing chromate of lead and Prussian
blue, as above mentioned, and is called Brunswick green. The
chrome should be free from acid or the color will fade; it may
be tested by placing it for several days in strong sunlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p><b>Proportions of Ingredients in Mixed Paint.</b>—The
composition of paints should be governed by the nature
of the material to be painted. Thus the paints respectively
best adapted for painting wood and iron differ considerably.
The kind of surface to be covered, <i>i. e.</i>, a porous surface requires
more oil than one that is impervious. The nature and
appearance of the work to be done. Delicate tints require
colorless oil; a flatted surface must be painted without oil,
which gives gloss to a shining surface. Again, paint used for
surfaces intended to be varnished must contain a minimum
of oil. The climate and the degree of exposure to which the
work will be subjected; thus, for outside work boiled oil is
used, because it weathers better than raw oil. Turps is
avoided as much as possible, because it evaporates and does
not last; if, however, the work is to be exposed to the sun,
turps are necessary to prevent the paint from blistering. The
skill of the painter also affects the composition; a good workman
can lay on even coats with a smaller quantity of oil and
turps than a man who is unskilful; extra turps, especially,
are often added to save labor. The quality of the materials
makes an important difference in the proportions used.
Thus more oil and turps will combine with pure than with
impure white lead; thick oil must be used in greater quantity
than thin oil. When paint is purchased ready ground in oil,
a soft paste will require less turps and oil for thinning than
a thick paste. Lastly, the different coats of paint vary in
their composition; the first coat laid on to new work requires
a good deal of oil to soak into the material; on old work the
first coat requires turpentine to make it adhere; the intermediate
coats contain a proportion of turpentine to make
them work smoothly, and to the final coats the coloring
materials are added, the remainder of the ingredients being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
varied as already described, according as the surface is to be
glossy or flatted.</p>

<p>The exact proportion of the ingredients best to be used in
mixing paints varies according to their quality, the nature of
the work required, the climate, and other considerations.
The composition of the paint for the different coats also varies
considerably. The proportions given in the following table,
must, therefore, only be taken as an approximate guide when
the materials are of good quality.</p>

<p>For every 100 square yards, besides the materials enumerated
in the foregoing, 2¹⁄₂ <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of white lead and 5 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of
putty will be required for stopping.</p>

<p>The area which a given quantity of paint will cover depends
upon the nature of the surface to which it is applied,
the proportion of the ingredients and the state of the weather.
When the work is required to dry quickly, more turpentine
is added to all the coats.</p>

<p>In repainting old work, two coats are generally required,
the old painting being considered as priming. Sometimes
another coat may be deemed necessary.</p>

<p>For outside old work exposed to the sun, both coats should
contain one pint of turpentine and four pints of boiled oil,
the remaining ingredients being as stated in the foregoing
table. The extra turpentine is used to prevent blistering.</p>

<p>In cold weather more turpentine should be used to make
the paint flow freely.</p>

<p><b>Operations.</b>—All priming should be rubbed out as far
as possible, for if it is flowed out loosely or laid on thick it
will be apt to blister and run. In priming over spots, however,
where <i>patching</i> is being done, it may sometimes be
necessary to leave the coat thick or heavy, for new work can
never be re-touched and look well, after the work is second
coated or finished; for such re-touching would show and
spoil the whole work. In priming the paint should flow
easily, and the brush should be pressed on to the wood so
that the paint will be forced into the pores. In all cases it
is a great saving of time to cover as large a surface as convenient
before smoothing or finishing off. All work on the
same surface should be finished at the one application, if
possible, for “laps”—which form the junctions of work done
at different times—should be avoided wherever they can, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
they are sure to disfigure the work where they exist. Of
course, it is sometimes impossible to avoid laps, but where
they must occur, care should be taken to make the connection
with as little “lap” as possible or it will be certain to show
through the work when finished. The defect, if occurring
during the second coating, will show much worse than in the
priming coat.</p>

<p>In painting, like everything else, a system must be followed
to make much headway. Experience, perhaps, is the only
effective teacher in this matter; and any rules laid down by
us will have but little effect, if the operator does not, or can
not systematize. The workman who follows a system will
do nearly twice as much work with less labor, than the man
who works only by the rule of thumb. In painting blinds,
lattices, railings, cut brackets or other similar work, some
method of operation should be adopted. A little observation
on the part of the operator, will soon teach him the best
methods to adopt in doing any particular kind of work.</p>

<p><b>Preparing the Work.</b>—In preparing work for painting,
too much care cannot be exercised, as succeeding coats
and the final result depend very much on the proper condition
of the work when the priming coat is applied. First,
all the rough places in the wood should be rubbed down
with a block covered with sandpaper; and the mouldings
and beads should be well cleaned out with sandpaper. Then
(and this is a matter of prime importance) every knot, however
small, every indication of sap on the wood, or discoloration
of any kind, and every appearance of pitch or gum,
should be carefully varnished over with white shellac varnish,
if the work is to be finished in white or light tints—or with
varnish made from unbleached or common shellac, if the
work is to be finished in dark shades. The common shellac,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
in the latter case, answers equally well with the bleached
article, and at less cost. This should not, under any circumstances,
be neglected, as it is impossible, in the nature of
things, otherwise to make good work.</p>

<p>When work is to be finished with two coats, the putty used
for stopping the nail-heads and other indentations should be
made of white lead, worked up with common whiting to the
proper consistency, and the filling should be done after the
first coat shall have become well dried. When more than
two coats are to be applied, the filling should be done
between the first and second coats, with ordinary pure linseed-oil
putty.</p>

<p>It should be adopted as a rule, never to apply pure white
as a priming coat; no matter whether the work is to be
finished with one or four coats, the result will always be more
satisfactory if the first coat be stained. A little finely-ground
lampblack answers as well for this as anything.</p>

<p>The only way to produce solid, uniform work, is by making
every succeeding coat lighter in tint than the one which
preceded it. This is especially the case with walls, and other
extended flat surfaces. No matter what the finish is to be,
the first coat should always be darker than the one which
succeeds it; and the darker the shade of the finishing coat,
the more important it is that this rule should be observed.
If the work is to be finished with black, prime with black.
If with green, let that be the color of all the preceding coats.
If with blue, let that color be the ground work. What can
be more stupid than applying to work which is to be finished
in imitation of black walnut a priming coat of white? All
work should be primed especially with regard to the finishing
color.</p>

<p>There is not half enough of dark colors used in priming
applications. Venetian red, finely ground in boiled oil,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
deeply stained with black—and used very thin, in order to
stain the wood as much as possible—is the best first coat for
work which is to be finished in imitation of black walnut or
other dark wood. The succeeding coats should be as dark
as may be with a view to the proper shade of ground-work
for the graining. In such case, if (as must happen in the
ordinary course of events) the work becomes bruised or
“chipped”—by an accidental knock from a chair leg or other
article of house furniture—the general appearance of it is
little impaired thereby. Quite the contrary, however, is the
case if the underneath coats are white. Then, an accident
of the kind before mentioned, shows a white spot, which
staringly proclaims the work to be a delusion and a sham.
Dark colors, too, as the Venetian red before mentioned,
make better foundations than white lead or zinc. They dry
harder and “rub” better, and, what is most important, cost
less.</p>

<p>This matter having been duly considered, let us now proceed
to the coats succeeding the first. Before applying a
second coat, the first should be carefully rubbed, and all the
nail-heads and other indentations carefully stopped with
pure linseed-oil putty—using for flat surfaces a square-bladed
putty-knife. Puttying with the fingers should never
be tolerated (good work is now the subject under consideration).
This done, the whole should be carefully examined
to ascertain if the oil in the former coat shall have revealed
any resinous or pitchy spots, not previously covered with
the shellac. These preliminaries being attended to, the work
may be considered ready for a second coat. The directions
as to rubbing with sandpaper are to be observed in all the
succeeding coats. As a rule, on interior work, paint should
never be applied to a surface which has not been previously
rubbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Sandpaper for fresh work and pumice-stone for old work.
Always distrust the education of a painter in his trade who
goes to work without a lump of pumice-stone, a sheet of
sandpaper, a putty-knife, and a rag to wipe off the spatters—sparks,
as the Irish not inaptly call them. Apropos of
spatters! Every painter has seen (the result too of unpardonable
negligence) plates of glass so covered with
spatters, that to remove them would require more time than
would serve to paint the woodwork of a “full-trimmed”
window.</p>

<p>In priming work which is to be finished in oak, finely-ground
French ochre is recommended. The objection to
this pigment, that it does not work smoothly and easily under
the brush, has arisen from its coarseness. Finely ground
in boiled oil, it works as smoothly as white lead, and makes
an excellent foundation for the succeeding coats.</p>

<p>For walls the first coat should be as dark in shade and as
thin as practicable, the object being to stain the plaster as
much as possible. Indeed, if the whole mass of plaster could
be stained through and through, it would be desirable to so
stain it.</p>

<p>The use of glue in wall painting is of doubtful propriety.
It should never, under any circumstance, be put on until
after the second coat, and then rubbed on with a rag, very
lightly. In first-class work, however, its use is not recommended.</p>

<p>Plaster mixed with weak glue-size—which prevents its
setting too rapidly—is the best material for stopping walls
preparatory to painting, and each coat of paint should be
carefully rubbed with worn sand-paper, before the succeeding
coat is put on. For preparing walls a small pocket-trowel
will be found a most serviceable tool, or a trowel-shaped
putty-knife, which article has come into general use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>The preparation of ceilings for whitewashing (or kalsomining
as this operation is sometimes pretentiously called) is an
operation requiring some skill and knowledge of “how to do
it.” A dirty ceiling, which has been subjected to successive
coats of whitewash, whether of lime, or of whiting and glue-size,
cannot be made solidly and smoothly white by additional
whitewashing. The mass has become spongy, and sucks up
the water so quickly that the material cannot be evenly distributed.
In such case the only way is to begin anew, to go
at once “down to hard pan” by removing all the previous
applications by washing and scraping. This is best effected
with a broad-bladed square-pointed putty-knife, keeping the
ceiling wet meanwhile. Plaster (hard-finish) is not of uniform
density, and some spots are much more absorbent than
others. To remedy this a mixture of soft soap and alum,
dissolved in water, should be applied with a broad kalsomine
brush.</p>

<p>It is not assumed that mere verbal instructions can teach
the art of whitening or tinting walls and ceilings in water-colors.
To produce good results, great skill in preparing the
materials and dexterity in manipulation are required; and
such work should be intrusted only to competent hands. A
mass of unsuitable material may be cheaply put upon a ceiling;
but when the same shall require repainting, the cost of
labor will be greater in removing the previous coating, than
will be the whole cost of repainting. These remarks, too,
apply equally to all kinds of painting; and reference is
made to the whitening and tinting of ceilings only, because
of the general impression that this kind of work may be performed
by anybody.</p>

<p>The materials and tools used in painting are too costly to
wasted and worn by incompetent handling. “Painting
just to keep the gardener or hostler out of idleness,” will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
prove in most cases a left-handed economy. Such experiments
are prudent only when the services of skilled workman
cannot be obtained.</p>

<p><b>Taste in Color.</b>—In rooms to be lived in, simple white
for color of walls and paint, as well as any extremely dark
treatment, should be avoided. The walls of rooms should be
such backgrounds as will best suit the complexions and
dresses of the larger number of people. Delicate white intensifies
by contrast any unpleasantness or want of perfection;
extreme dark would make people look white and ghastly.
Neutral colors will be found the best—generally some grey
or cool color that will contrast with warmth of complexions.
On no account let an absolutely pure color be used for
general surfaces. Nature provides no such color in pigments.
Her yellows are greenish or reddish, and so on. Nor does
she use it to any extent in inanimate nature. So much so
that you will find that if you have much difficulty in describing
a color, you may be certain it is good; the more difficulty
the more beauty. Nature trusts mainly to gradations of tone,
using vivid color in small quantities only, as in the touches
on bright flowers and butterflies. This teaching of nature
will be found seconded in the pictures of the greatest artists,
and in following such teaching, it is necessary to consider the
object to which (in domestic work, say) the rooms are to be
devoted. A drawing-room, it is agreed, should be light,
festive and gay; dining-room at once more sober, and with
more depth and warmth, as befits its uses. You must also
consider the light and shade; openings, and the positions of
them; for these may (or may not) effect for you contrast of
tone, and may even touch the question of the good sense of
your whole scheme of decoration.</p>

<p>In a lecture delivered before the British Architectural Association,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
on this subject, the lecturer suggested that in the
treatment of a drawing-room the walls should be a light
neutral grey, fawn color, or pale green (not dark, but not
white). Dados are suitable for all rooms, even drawing-rooms.
They may be made of wood, painted as the room
doors, or of stamped leather, or of the French paper imitations
of stamped leather. A frieze does not interfere with the
heads of sitters, and adds much interest if it has its sentiment
or story. If flowers form part of your decorations, have no
relief, no imitation of nature’s light and shade. A wall must
be a wall; if, neglecting this, you introduce illusions to the
eye, the sense of solidity will not be suggested. The Japanese
decorate on correct principles, with truth to the idea derived
from nature, and truth in art, adaptation of representation to
materials and method. As regards the woodwork there
should be no graining anywhere; its aspect, however well
executed, is repulsive. Real woods are always beautiful.
Plain painting may be darker or lighter than the general wall
surfaces; both will look well. The doors may have stencilled
decorations in angles of panels; birds or butterflies, or plants,
or any beautiful natural objects will supply motives. The
ceilings should rarely be wholly white, except of halls or
where the light is defective. Papered ceilings look well.
The use of gold is generally satisfactory; it reflects a warm
tone on everything below. Put a good amount of color on a
ceiling—not, however, making it so dark as to bring it too
close to the eye. The carpet must be either lighter or darker
than the walls. This is following out the artist’s rule, to
make either background or foreground run into the figure.
If this is not done in painting, a woman in white satin, for
instance, against a dark floor and dark walls, will look like a
cut-out figure stuck on, and the same sort of result would
occur in rooms. As in ordinary life dresses are dark in color,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
where a light wall tone has been recommended, the carpet
will have to be darker than the walls. Not too vivid in
color, however, and of course, no flowers, ferns, birds’ nests,
and such like fearful things. <i>Furniture and hangings</i> should
not be too much alike in color; have, say, the carpet one
tone, the coverings of the furniture another, and the curtains
and other hangings a third. Have summer and winter hangings
and furniture coverings; those for the former light and
cheerful, the others with more warmth, and suggestive of comfort
and home life. A table-cloth, occasional chair, or a
rug, may supply a bit of effective contrast with prevailing
hues of hangings, etc., and a spot of vivid color in a vase or
some small hanging will complete the formal decoration of
the room.</p>

<p><b>Graining.</b>—The art of imitating the grain of the more
expensive woods has been brought to a great degree of perfection,
but of late years so many unskilled workmen have
undertaken to imitate the natural grain of wood with such
imperfect results, that this beautiful branch of painting has
fallen into partial disuse. A few remarks, therefore, to the
uninitiated may not be inappropriate in this work. Mahogany,
satinwood, rosewood, mottled and walnut roots, maple,
and some others, are frequently imitated; and it is seldom
that a house is finished without some graining being introduced.
The imitation of the above-mentioned woods are
best performed in ground distemper (water colors) which are
always preferable and more economical purchased ready prepared.
Oak, chestnut, ash and similar long-grained woods,
are best executed in oil-color, particularly for outdoor work.
For drawing rooms, delicate party colors are preferable, as
they harmonize better with the neutral tints on the walls or
delicate tinted papers. The process of graining is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
simple. To be an accomplished grainer, practice and an
artistic taste is very necessary. Too frequently the imitation
is overdone, the shading too deep and obtrusive, and the
work made too glaring with figure and varnish, has an unnatural
appearance; a grainer should always avoid attempting
to over-do nature. The following is an approved
method:—The surface on new wood should be prepared with
three coats of oil paints for the ground color, and regulated
in shade by the color of the wood to be imitated, making due
allowance for the graining tint that is to cover it. The
ground colors should always be perfectly dry before the graining
is commenced. The painter then preparing small quantities
of the colors he requires, applies it thinly and evenly over
the surface and proceeds to wipe out with his thumb and a
piece of white cotton cloth the figure of the grain. Some
grainers use rubber instead. We cannot here explain all the
different processes for the imitation of the grain of wood.
Many painters have a method of their own, which from long
practice produce excellent results. In some cases, graining
in distemper may be adopted with great success for indoor
work, and if the colors are put on thin, so that the varnish
will penetrate through into the ground color, this kind of
graining is as durable as oil-color, and is susceptible of being
made far more beautiful, and soft looking in the imitation of
mottled woods. For blending distemper colors, a badger’s
hair blender should be frequently used to soften down and
blend the tints where necessary; but for blending oil-color,
in order to produce an elongation of the grain, we have found
a flat varnish brush, kept moderately damp and clean, preferable
to the badger’s hair. When the work is dry, the
shades necessary for some woods should be laid on in distemper-color
(some use thin oil-colors) and then covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
two coats of good oil varnish. Common varnish should
never be used on outside work.</p>

<p><b>Oak Graining.</b>—In oak graining the color is made in
the following manner:—Procure some finely-ground burnt
umber and raw sienna (or Vandyke brown and raw sienna if
a dark oak be required), and thin with equal parts of linseed
oil and turpentine. Add a large quantity of patent dryer to
make it stand the comb. The color is now ready for use.
The graining color is brushed over the work in the ordinary
way with a pound brush, care being taken not to put too
much color on, else it is liable to look dirty. A dry dusting
brush is now used to stipple with, which, if properly done,
will distribute the color evenly. It is now ready for combing.
First take a medium or coarse-cut gutta-percha comb,
and draw it down one side of the panel, then use a finer one
to complete it. This comb will leave the marks of the grain
in clear unbroken lines from top to bottom of the panel. We
now take a fine steel comb and go over the whole of the previous
combing; but in drawing this comb down, we either
move it in a slanting or diagonal direction across the previous
combing, or draw it down with a quick and short wavy
motion and curl. Both the former and latter motions will
break up the long lines left by the gutta-percha comb into
short bits, which, of course, represent the pores or grains of
the real wood. Next take out the lights of figuring or veining.
This is effected by means of a piece of washleather,
held tightly over the thumb nail. Every time a few lights
are wiped out the leather should be moved slightly, so that
the same part of the leather will not be used twice, thus ensuring
clean work. There are various methods of doing this,
but they require much more practice. When the figures are
all wiped out they will require to be softened. By softening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
we mean the imitation of those half shades seen upon and
about the figures in the real wood. These are imitated by
doubling a piece of washleather into a small roll, and with
the side of this the grain is partly wiped away or softened.
Care should be taken not to wipe off the whole of the grain.
If the operator has a piece of the real wood to look at occasionally
he will be materially assisted. As soon as the oil
color is dry it should be over-grained. This is effected in
water color. Next go over the work with a bit of sponge
and soap to prevent it “cissing.” Before laying on the over-graining,
wash out the sponge and wipe the work. It is now
ready to receive the color. Grind up finely a little vandyke
brown in water, and dilute it with table-beer and water. It
is then ready. Take a flat hog-hair brush, 3 in. to 4 in. wide,
dip it in the color and draw it over the work, in most cases
in the direction of the combing, but occasionally crossing.
The hair of the brush, being thinly placed, will separate into
patches, and hence the color will be deposited in streaks, resembling
the natural gradations which the wood presents. If
you have not a brush of this kind a sponge may be used to
put in the streak and to soften off. Then dry varnish in the
usual way.</p>

<p><b>Spirit Graining for Oak.</b>—2 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> whiting, ¹⁄₄ <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> gold
size, thinned down with spirits of turpentine, then tinge your
whiting with vandyke brown and raw sienna ground fine.
Strike out your light with a pitch or piece of rubber dipped
in turpentine, tinged with a little color to show the lights. If
your lights do not appear clear, add a little more turpentine.
Turpentine varnish is a good substitute for the above mentioned.
This kind of graining must be brushed over with
beer with a clean brush before varnishing. Strong beer must
be used for glazing up top graining and shading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p><b>Old Oak in Distemper.</b>—To make an exceedingly
rich color for the imitation of old oak, the ground is a composition
of stone ochre or orange chrome and burnt sienna;
the graining is burnt umber or vandyke brown, to darken it
a little. The above colors may be used for oil as well.</p>

<p><b>Pollard Oak.</b>—Ground color, a mixture of chrome
yellow, vermilion and white lead, to bring it to a rich light
buff. The graining colors are vandyke brown and small
portions of raw and burnt sienna and lake, ground in beer or
vinegar. Fill a large brush with color and spread it over the
surface to be grained, and soften with a badger hair brush.
Take a moistened sponge and dapple round and round in
kind of knobs, then soften very lightly, after which draw a
softener from one set of knobs to the other while wet, to form
a multiplicity of grain, and finish the knobs with a hair pencil,
in some places in thicker clusters than others. When dry,
put the top grain on in a variety of directions, and varnish
with turpentine and gold size; then glaze up with vandyke
and strong beer. Finish with copal varnish. This is for
distemper only.</p>

<p><b>Mottled Mahogany.</b>—The ground is prepared with
the best Venetian red, red lead, and a small proportion of
white lead. The graining colors are burnt sienna, ground in
beer, with a small portion of vandyke brown. Cover the surface
to be grained, soften with a badger hair brush, and while
wet take a damp sponge and go over the lights a second
time, in order to give a variety of shade; then blend the
whole of the work with the badger softener. Put the top
grain on with the same color. When dry, varnish. For distemper
only.</p>

<p><b>Rosewood.</b>—Mix vermilion and a small quantity of
white lead for the ground. Take rose-pink, tinged with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
little lamp-black or vandyke brown, and grind very fine in
oil, then take a flat graining brush, with the hairs cut away
at unequal distances, and cut down the grain as if wending
round a knob. When nearly dry, take a graining comb that
is used for oak, and draw down the grain. This will give it
the appearance of nature. Then varnish. This makes an
excellent and durable imitation.</p>

<p><b>Another for Rosewood.</b>—This ground is prepared
with vermilion and small quantities of white lead and crimson
lake. When the ground is dry, and made very smooth, take
vandyke brown, ground in oil, and with a very soft tool
spread the color over the surface in different directions, forming
a kind of knots. Before the work is dry take a piece of
leather, and with great freedom strike out the light veins;
having previously prepared the darkest tint of vandyke brown
or gum asphaltum, immediately take the flat graining brush
with few hairs in it, called a top grainer, and draw the grain
over the work and soften. When varnished, the imitation
will be excellent.</p>

<p><b>Curled Maple in Oil.</b>—Prepare a rich ground by mixing
chrome yellow, white lead and burnt sienna. For the
graining color, grind equal parts of raw sienna and umber
with a little burnt copperas and turpentine, and mix it with a
small quantity of grainer’s cream, thin the color with oil;
then fill a tool and spread the surface even and rub out the
lights with sharp edge of a piece of buff leather, wiping it
frequently to keep it clean; soften the edges of the work very
lightly, and when dry, put on the top grain with burnt umber
and raw sienna ground in beer with the white of an egg beat
into it. Varnish.</p>

<p><b>Curled Maple in Distemper.</b>—Prepare a light yellow
for the ground, by mixing chrome yellow and white lead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
tinged with Venetian red. The graining color is a mixture of
equal portions of raw sienna and vandyke brown, ground in
beer. Spread the surface to be grained in an even manner;
then with a piece of cork rub across the work to and fro, to
form the grains which run across the wood; soften, and when
dry lightly top grain with the same color. Varnish.</p>

<p><b>Bird’s Eye Maple in Oil.</b>—The ground is a light
buff, prepared with white lead, chrome yellow and a little
vermilion or English Venetian, to take off the rawness of the
yellow. The graining color is equal parts of raw umber and
sienna, ground in oil to the proper consistency. Spread the
surface of the work with this color, and having some of the
same prepared a little thicker, immediately take a sash tool
or sponge and put on the dark shades, and soften with a
badger hair brush; before the color is dry put on the eyes by
dabbing the dotting machine on the work, or by striking the
colors short and sharp with the tips of the fingers, then blend
slightly the eyes in one direction only. When dry, put on the
grain with the camels hair pencil on the prominent parts to
imitate the small hearts of the wood. The same graining
colors to be ground in here for distemper.</p>

<p><b>Walnut in Oil.</b>—The ground is formed with ochre,
Indian red, umber, and white. The graining coat is similar
to that described under the oak heading, and is prepared
with vandyke brown; and for the darker shades, fine ivory-black;
the wiping out and blending to resemble that in
mahogany; the fine dark veins of ivory-black to be lightly
and wavily drawn over the work after it is blended. It is
then ready for the varnish.</p>

<p><b>Satin-wood in Distemper.</b>—This ground is prepared
with white lead, stone ochre and small quantities of chrome
yellow and burnt sienna. The graining color is one-third of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
raw sienna and whiting, ground in pale ale, very thin; then
spread the color over the surface to be grained. While wet
soften, and have ready a wet roller or mottling brush, in order
to take out the lights; blend the whole with the badger hair
brush, and with the same color put on the top grain. Varnish.</p>

<p><b>To Imitate Granite in Oil.</b>—For the ground color,
stain your white lead to a light lead color, with lamp-black
and a little rose-pink. Throw on black spots with a coarse
brush or graniting machine. A pale red also, and fill up with
white before the ground is dry.</p>

<p><b>Another for the Same.</b>—A black ground; when half
dry throw in vermilion, a deep yellow, and white spots.</p>

<p><b>Marble.</b>—For <i>White Marble</i>, get up a pure white ground,
then hold a lighted tallow candle near the surface, and allow
the smoke to form the shades and various tints desired. This
will make a very handsome imitation. <i>Black Marble.</i>—Imitation
is made by streaking a black surface with colors,
using a feather and pencil. Another plan is to get up a
smooth black surface; then take the colors, green, yellow,
red, white, etc., ground thick in gold size, and streak the surface
with a stick or hair pencil. Allow it to dry, and apply a
heavy coat of lamp-black and yellow ochre mixed, mixed
rough stuff. When all is hard, rub down to a level surface
with lump pumice-stone, varnish and a beautiful variegated
marble will be the result.</p>

<p><b>Red Marble.</b>—For the ground put on a white tinged
with lake or vermilion; then apply deep red patches, filling
up the intermediate spaces with brown and white mixed in
oil; then blend them together; if in quick drying colors, use
about half turpentine and gold size. When dry, varnish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
and while the varnish is wet, put in a multitude of fine white
threads, crossing the whole work in all directions, as the wet
varnish brings the pencil to a fine point.</p>

<p><b>Jasper Marble.</b>—Put on a white ground lightly tinged
with blue; then put on patches of rich reds or rose-pink,
leaving spaces of the white ground; then partly cover these
spaces with various browns to form fossils, in places running
veins; then put in a few spots of white in the centre of some
of the red patches, and leaving, in places, masses nearly white.
When dry use the clearest varnish.</p>

<p><b>Blue and Gold Marble.</b>—For the ground color put on
a light blue; then take blue, with a small piece of white lead
and some dark common blue, and dab on the ground in
patches, leaving portions of the ground to shine between;
then blend the edges together with a duster or a softener;
afterwards draw on some white veins in every direction, leaving
large open spaces to be filled up with a pale yellow or
gold paint; finish with some fine white running threads, and
a coat of varnish at last.</p>

<p><b>Black and Gold Marble.</b>—This description of marble
is very chaste, and is in great demand. The ground is a
deep black, or a dead color, in gold size, drop black and turpentine;
second coat, black japan. Commence veining;
mix white and yellow ochre with a small quantity of vermilion
to give a gold tinge; dip the pencil in this color, and dab on
the ground with great freedom some large patches, from
which small threads must be drawn in several directions.</p>

<p>In the deepest part of the black a white vein is sometimes
seen running with a number of small veins attached to it, but
care must be taken that these threads are connected with and
run, in some degree, in the same direction with the thicker
veins. If durability is not an object, and the work required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
in a short time, it may be executed very quickly in distemper
colors, and when varnished, it will look well.</p>

<p><b>Compound Colors.</b>—The following tints can be formed
by mixing the colors as below. The shades can be made to
suit any taste by the exercise of a little judgment in proportioning
the colors:</p>

<p><i>Cream.</i>—White lead, yellow and red.</p>

</div>

<hr class="r5" />
<p><b>For Iron.</b>—A good paint for preserving iron exposed to
the weather, is made as follows:</p>

<p>Pulverized oxides of iron, such as yellow and red iron
ochres, or brown hematite iron ores, finely ground, and simply
mixed with linseed oil and a dryer.</p>

<p>White lead applied directly to iron is thought to have a
corrosive effect. It may be applied over more durable
colors.</p>

<p>Red lead, when pure, is very durable. An instance is recorded
of iron painted with it having been under water for
nearly 50 years, and had not been affected by rust.</p>

<p>Sheet iron, before being used for roofs or other outside
purposes, should be heated and dipped into hot linseed oil,
which will penetrate into it. Tinned iron in roofs has been
found to corrode quicker than in former years, owing to the
more general use of coal.</p>

<p><b>Paint for Rusty Iron.</b>—Black Japan varnish, mixed
with turpentine, to make it thinner if necessary, is one of the
best preventatives; but the iron must be dry when you put
it on. If you can warm the iron when painting it, so much
the better. If not sufficiently opaque, you may put in dry
finely pulverized paint, such as lamp-black. Red lead, with linseed
oil is also a good paint for rusted iron; so are the mineral
reddish-browns which consist of oxide of iron; they become
very hard, and are used for the iron-work of the elevated
railroads in this city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p><b>To Paint on Stucco.</b>—Great care is required in painting
upon stucco, for the work must not only be thoroughly
dry, but free from any liability of dampness; that is to say,
the walls themselves must be dry. It is, consequently, usual
to allow the stucco to remain for several months before it is
painted; and this is especially necessary when it covers over
a large surface, as in the walls of churches, chapels and
theatres. If the paint be applied too soon, the work will have
a blotched appearance, and be probably filled with small
vesicles, formed during the evaporation of the water. When
the work is dry, it may be prepared by covering it with a coat
of linseed oil, boiled with dryer. This must be laid on very
carefully, or the face will be irregular. The color may then
be applied, and four coats will not be too much, the work
being new. Persons are generally so anxious to have their
buildings finished, that they disregard the future appearance
of the work, and within a few weeks after the application of
the stucco, cover it with paint. But it would, in all cases, be
sufficient to wash the surface with distemper, as it would give
a finished appearance to the building, and make it less necessary
to hurry the work. When the work is sufficiently dry to
receive the oil-colors the distemper color should be removed
by washing, and when the stucco is dry apply the oil-color.
The tints may be regulated by mingling different colors, as in
all other kinds of painting.</p>

<p>Plastered walls should not be painted until they are
thoroughly dry, and all settling in a new house has taken
place. If painted too soon they will blister.</p>

<p>Unseasoned wood should never be painted, as it stops the
pores of the wood and the sap acidulates, causing dry rot.
Greasy surfaces must be washed with water mixed with lime
or soda, otherwise the paint will not adhere to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p><b>Mixing Quick Drying Paint.</b>—Venetian blinds
should be painted to dry dead, then varnish; but few take
this trouble. Mix the paint as under: White lead, boiled
oil, and the least drop of turps; mix sufficient of each to
form a creamy mixture; then add about 1 <abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> patent drier
to each 1 <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> of paint. If you want the paint darker use
enough burnt umber to give the required tint. If you want
to varnish, omit the oil and use turps.</p>

<p><b>Transparent Paint for Glass.</b>—Take for blue pigment,
Prussian blue; for red, crimson lake; for yellow,
Indian yellow; and for other shades, a mixture of the appropriate
primary colors. Rub them in a size made as follows:
Venice turpentine, 2 parts; spirits of turpentine, 1 part, and
apply with a brush. The colors are moderately fast unless
exposed too long to direct sunlight. A solution of the various
aniline dyes in shellac varnish has also been recommended.</p>

<p><b>Gilding.</b>—Gold leaf is the only successful application.
First put on a coat of Japan gold size, and when that is
“tacky,” and nearly dry, lay on the gold-leaf and dab it with
a small tuft of cotton-wool. Where you buy the gold-leaf
you can buy a gilder’s tool for applying it; but in order to
get a smooth surface it must (when perfectly dry) be burnished
with an agate burnisher, which you will also get at the color-shop,
but you will not be able to burnish gold-leaf on the
bare wood. You can, if you like, varnish with pale copal
varnish.</p>

<p><b>Gilding on Glass.</b>—Glass letters are gilt the same way
as you would a name on a glass door. You can easily get
a good burnish if you take a little trouble. Get some of the
best cotton wool at a chemist’s, and well polish the gold with
it; the gold must be thoroughly dry. Then go over it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
your size boiling hot; do not touch the same place twice with
the brush, or you will bring the gold up; repeat the process
three or four times, being sure to have your gold dry each
time, the hotter the size the brighter will be the burnish; be
careful, however, and not break the glass with the heat.</p>

<p><b>Gilding Fretwork, etc.</b>—The first thing to be done
is to whiten the work. To do this scrape some whitening
very fine, place it in a pipkin with a lump of gilder’s size, and
water sufficient to make it of the consistency of thick cream,
when heated over a fire; then, with a camel-hair pencil, paint
it on the object several times, allowing each coat to dry before
applying the next. When the several coatings have
raised it to the thickness of ¹⁄₁₆ in., set it aside for twelve or
more hours, to harden; when hardened, smooth the surface
with very fine sandpaper first, and finally with a piece of
cork; when using the cork frequently dip it in water, and,
when practicable, use it in a circular motion. Thus far successful,
the next thing is to lay on the gold. To gild, then,
dissolve some gilder’s—not common size—in water, and heat,
and with a full brush lay it on the surface of the object. Cut
the gold leaf, on a pad of buff leather, with a clean cut of the
knife (much easier said than done; perseverance, however,
with the cost of a book or two of gold mutilated, and a large
amount of patience exhausted, will overcome the difficulty),
to the size required; take these up on a tip (a row of long
hairs placed between two bits of cardboard)—the professional
way to do this is to strike the hair of the tip against the
gilder’s own whiskers or hair—and gently lay them on the
surface of the object, taking care that each succeeding piece
slightly overlaps the preceding. When dry, a small piece of
fine sponge, dipped in a weak solution of size water, should
be gently passed over it to give a uniform appearance. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
the bright gold requires to be deadened, deep ormolu should
be used in a similar way after sizing. The yellow used for
the ungilt portions consists of gilder’s yellow, dissolved in size
water, and is put on with a brush.</p>

<p><b>Painting on Gilded Panels.</b>—There is no preparation
needed to paint in oils on a gilded panel. No mediums
are required, the ordinary oil colors being used unmixed. If
required to dry flat and to remain so, they are mixed with
turpentine and left unvarnished. If the shiny look of oils is
to be retained, they are slightly diluted with boiled oil, and
varnish with white hard varnish when dry.</p>

<p><b>Gilding on Wood.</b>—To gild in oil, the wood, after being
properly smoothed, is covered with a coat of <i>gold size</i>, made
of drying linseed oil mixed with yellow ochre; when this has
become so dry as to adhere to the fingers without soiling
them, the gold leaf is laid on with great care and dexterity,
and pressed down with cotton wool; places that have been
missed are covered with small pieces of gold leaf, and when
the whole is dry, the ragged bits are rubbed off with cotton.
This is by far the easiest mode of gilding; any other metallic
leaves may be applied in a similar manner. <i>Pale leaf gold</i>
has a greenish yellow color, and is an alloy of gold with silver.
Dutch gold leaf is only copper colored with the fumes of
zinc; being much cheaper than gold leaf, is very useful when
large quantities of gilding are required in places where it can
be defended by the weather, as it changes color if exposed to
moisture, and it should be covered with varnish. <i>Silver leaf</i>
is prepared every way the same as gold leaf; but when applied,
should be kept well with varnish, otherwise it is liable
to tarnish; a transparent yellow varnish will give it the appearance
of gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Whenever gold is fixed by means of linseed oil, it will bear
washing off, which burnished gold will not.</p>

<p><b>To Gild Letters.</b>—When the sign is prepared as smooth
as possible, go over it with a sizing made by white of an egg
dissolved in about four times its weight of cold water; adding
a small quantity of fuller’s earth, this to prevent the gold
sticking to any part but letters. When dry, set out the letters
and commence writing, laying on the size as thinly as possible,
with a sable pencil. Let it stand until you can hardly
feel a slight stickiness, then go to work with your gold leaf
knife and cushion, and gild the letters. Take a leaf upon the
point of your knife, after giving it a slight puff into the back
part of your cushion, and spread it on the front part of it as
straight as possible, give it another slight puff with your mouth
to flatten it out. Now cut it to the proper size, cutting with
the heel of your knife forwards. Now rub the tip of the
knife lightly on your hair; take up the gold on the point, and
place it neatly on the letters; when they are all covered, get
some very fine cotton wool, and gently rub the gold until it
is smooth and bright. Then wash the sign with clean water
to take off the egg size.</p>

<p><b>Sign Writing in Colors, Etc.</b>—On an oak ground
ornamental letters, in ultra-marine blue, filled in with gold
and silver leaf, blocked up and shaded with burnt sienna.
<i>Another.</i>—Gold letters on a white marble ground, blocked up
and shaded with a transparent brown or burnt sienna. <i>On
glass.</i>—Gold letters shaded with burnt sienna. <i>Another.</i>—Gold
letters shaded with black on a <i>scarlet</i> or <i>chocolate ground</i>.
On a rich <i>blue ground</i> shaded with black, look very well. <i>On
a purple</i> ground, pink letters shaded with white. Mix ultra-marine
and vermilion for a ground color, white letters shaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
with grey. <i>Vermilion ground</i>, chrome yellow stained and
vermilion and lake, for the letters shaded with black.</p>

<p>A substitute for the above colors: Rose-pink and red lead;
and for the letters stone yellow, white lead and Venetian red.
Mix your colors for writing in boiled oil, and use for dryer
gold size. Other good grounds for gold letters are, blues,
vermilion, lake and Saxon. When your sign is ready for
gilding, follow the directions under the head “<i>To Gild Letters
on Wood</i>.”</p>

<p><b>Gilder’s Size.</b>—Drying or boiled linseed oil, thickened
with yellow ochre, or calcined red ochre, and carefully reduced
to the utmost smoothness by grinding. It is thinned
with oil of turpentine.</p>

<p><b>Staining Wood a Dull Black.</b>—The work required
to be stained should be colored with drop-black and size.
When this is thoroughly set it should be papered off and
colored again, and then be papered off again. The polish
should also be stained with drop black and a little indigo.
Next polish to a perfect surface, and let it set. After the
wood has absorbed all the polish possible, polish again, and
dull it with the finger dipped in fine emery; a fine metallic
surface will thus be obtained.</p>

<p><b>Staining Floors.</b>—The best and cheapest and only
permanent stain for floors is permanganate of potash. Buy
it by the ¹⁄₄ <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr>, and at a wholesale chemist’s; mix about
¹⁄₄ <abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> in a quart of water. Apply freely and quickly to a dry
floor with either cloth or brush, the latter if you care for staining
your hand. Repeat the process for a very dark oak
color; when dry, oil with burnt oil or beeswax and turpentine;
you cannot wash this color out. Benson’s stain is only
permanganate of potash. At first for a few moments the
color is bright magenta, but this at once changes to a dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
permanent brown. For fifty cents a whole house may be
stained.</p>

<p><b>Varnishing Wood.</b>—After smoothing wood with veneer
scraper, brush on thick coat of shellac varnish; then use fine
sandpaper, No. 0. Do this three times for close grained
woods, such as black cherry, and four times for porous wood,
such as chestnut. Have two dishes. Into one put finely
ground pumice; into the other raw or boiled oil. Apply a
mixture of these with a piece of hair-cloth or broad-cloth.
Don’t rub too hard. Finish up with rotten stone, which will
remove pumice and oil. Above is a good dead varnish.
<i>Another.</i>—Take encaustic wax, heat, and apply with a
cork; rub in well, brush on thin coat shellac varnish, finish
with pumice and oil.</p>

<p><b>Solvent for Old Putty and Paint.</b>—Soft soap
mixed with a solution of potash or caustic soda, or pearlash
and slaked lime mixed with sufficient water to form a paste.
Either of these laid on with an old brush or rag, and left for
some hours, will render the putty or paint easily removable.
<i>Another.</i>—Slack three pounds of stone quicklime in water,
then add one pound of pearlash, and make the whole
about the consistence of paint. Apply it to both sides of the
glass, and let it remain for twelve hours, when the putty will
be so softened that the glass may be easily taken out of the
frame. <i>Another.</i>—Break the putty up in lumps the size of a
hen’s egg, add a small portion of raw linseed oil, and water
sufficient to cover the putty, boil this in an iron vessel for
about ten minutes and stir it when hot. The oil will mix
with the putty, then pour the water off and it will be like
fresh made. For removing hard putty from a window sash
take a piece of square iron, make the same red hot, and run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
it along the putty till it gets soft. The putty will peel off
without injuring the wood work.</p>

<p><b>Wash for Outside Work.</b>—For woodwork slake half
a bushel of fresh lime, by pouring over it boiling water sufficient
to cover it 4 or 5 inches deep, stirring it until slacked;
add 2 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of sulphate of zinc (white vitrol) dissolved in water.
Add water enough to bring all to the consistency of thick
whitewash; it may be colored by adding powdered ether, Indian
red, umber, etc. If lampblack is added to colors, it
should first be thoroughly dissolved in alcohol. The sulphate
of zinc causes the wash to become hard in a few weeks.</p>

<p><b>Another for Brick, Masonry, and Rough-cast.</b>
Slake half a bushel of lime as before; then fill a barrel ²⁄₃
full of water, and add a bushel of hydraulic cement. Add
3 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of sulphate of zinc previously dissolved in water. The
whole should be of the thickness of paint. The wash is improved
by stirring in a peck of white sand, just before using
it. It can be colored as before described.</p>

<p><b>French Polish.</b>—Coat with one or more coats of
shellac and rub down smooth; make a rubber by rolling up
a piece of flannel about 3 or 4 inches wide until it is about
1¹⁄₂ inches in diameter, and tie it round with cord. Lay the
end of the rubber on the mouth of a thin necked bottle and
apply the varnish to it, having previously shaken up the contents
in the bottle; then enclose the end of the rubber with a
piece of soft linen doubled, and moisten the face of the linen
with a little raw linseed oil.</p>

<p>Pass the rubber with a quick, light and circular motion over
the surface until the varnish becomes dry, or nearly so, and
charge the rubber again with varnish until 3 coats have been
laid on, when a little oil may be applied to the rubber and
two more coats laid on. In the finishing coat wet the inside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
of the cloth with a little alcohol, and rub quickly and lightly
over the whole surface. Lastly wet the linen cloth with a
little oil and alcohol without varnish, and rub as before until
dry.</p>

<p>The varnish is the usual preparation of shellac. See
cabinet maker’s varnish.</p>

<p><b>Wood Filling Composition.</b>—Boiled linseed oil, 1
<abbr title="quart">qt.</abbr>; turpentine, 3 <abbr title="quarts">qts.</abbr>; corn starch, 5 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>; Japan, 1 <abbr title="quart">qt.</abbr>;
calcined magnesia, 2 <abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr>; mix thoroughly. <i>Another.</i>—Whitening,
6 <abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr>; Japan, ¹⁄₂ <abbr title="pint">pt.</abbr>; boiled linseed oil,
¹⁄₂ <abbr title="pint">pt.</abbr>; turpentine, ¹⁄₂ <abbr title="pint">pt.</abbr>; corn starch, 1 <abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr>; mix well together
and apply to the wood. Add coloring if required.
<i>Another.</i>—Linseed oil, 1 <abbr title="quart">qt.</abbr>; spirits of turpentine, ¹⁄₂ <abbr title="pint">pt.</abbr>;
lime, the size of a base-ball, broken fine. Let the mixture
simmer on a stove, covered over, for two or three hours, then
strain through a coarse cloth. It is to remain on 24 hours,
then rub off with a woolen cloth and polish.</p>

<p><b>German Filling.</b>—Fill the pores with raw tallow and
plaster of Paris well amalgamated before a fire in cold
weather. Darken, if required, with any coloring to suit.
When well rubbed in give a coat of shellac and French polish
or varnish.</p>

<p><b>Polish for Walnut Wood.</b>—Mix with two parts of
good alcoholic shellac varnish, one part of boiled linseed oil,
shake well, and apply with a pad formed of woolen cloth.
Rub the furniture briskly with a little of the mixture until the
polish appears.</p>

<p><b>Rules the Painter Should Observe.</b>—Never eat
or sleep without washing the hands and face and rinsing the
mouth. Keep the buckets, brushes, etc., clean, so that they
may be handled without smearing the hands. Never sleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
in a paint shop nor in a newly painted room. Never allow
paint to accumulate on the clothing or finger nails. Never
wash the hands in turpentine, as it relaxes the muscles and
injures the joints; any animal oil or even linseed oil is better.
Never drink water that has stood any length of time in a
paint shop or newly painted room. Never use spirituous
liquors as it unites with the mineral salts and tends to harden
them and causes inflammation of the parts where they concrete.
Milk, sweet oil and the like should be used freely, as
they tend to soften the accumulated poisons and carry them
off. Vinegar and acid fruits used constantly, unite.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PAPER-HANGING">PAPER-HANGING.</h2>
</div>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>The art of putting on, or “Hanging” paper is very simple,
and is easily learned; but to make a tasteful choice of paper
for various situations, is not so easy, hence the following remarks,
which may be of service to the workman or others on
whom the selection of paper may devolve.</p>

<p>Walls to a room should be regarded only in the light of a
frame-work to what the room contains, and should be decorated
so as to bring into prominence and not eclipse the other
parts of the chamber. Nothing destroys the effect of a room
so much as a handsome but staring wall paper, or a wall so
profusely ornamented as to strike upon the eye to the exclusion
of the rest of the decorations, thus bringing forward
what should be the background into the most conspicuous
place. A modern drawing room is always difficult to decorate
artistically, because of the taste of its builders for heavy
cornices, prominent mantelpieces, and rooms too lofty for
their size; and as all these misnamed “embellishments” are
too costly to remove by tenants, the only plan to pursue is to
destroy their effect by exercising both taste and ingenuity.
First, with regard to the ceiling, the ornamental plaster boss
in its center should be removed, and the ceiling tinted a color
that harmonizes with the wall paper, as no harmonies can be
hoped for when what produces them is surmounted with the
glaring white of an ordinary ceiling. The tint used must be
one that softens into the wall paper, not one that contrasts;
thus, if the tone of the room is that of a soft grey blue, the
ceiling should be a clear flesh pink; or should a grey gre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
picked out with black be the chosen color, then it should be
colored a subdued lemon.</p>

<p>Some people cover their ceilings with a whole colored
paper, and border it with a stencilled pattern representing the
thin garlands so familiar upon Queen Anne decorations, but
this is a more troublesome plan than the simple coloring,
which answers all the purpose. The walls, if they are lofty,
require a high dado. These high dados give a look of comfort
and “home” that is absent from the modern high pitched
room papered with one uniform pattern. The dado is
divided 3 feet to 4 feet from the ceiling, and the coloring of
the lower portion must always be heavier than that used on
the upper or a top heavy look will be given to the room.
When many pictures are to be hung up the lower part of the
dado should be of a whole color, either a whole colored paper
or a painted wall, as pictures are only shown off upon such a
background. Where a whole tint is used for the lower part
of the dado, the upper portion should be decorated with a
frieze paper of a good bold pattern, but of subdued coloring
and of tint that harmonizes with the lower. Thus, the color
used about the frieze should be the same as that on the lower
part, but of a lighter shade, intermixed with some other colors
that form a harmonious link between the two shades. Contrasts
must be carefully avoided, but pale pinks, blue and
ambers can be blended together above a subdued grey blue
ground. The two portions of the dado should be joined
together with a light wooden (black or brown) railing, or with
a line of paint.</p>

<p>The dado decoration can be altered by placing the pattern
paper upon the lower part and leaving the upper plain-colored
with or without a stencilled pattern upon it. This will suit a
room where not many pictures are required, or that is already
rather dark. Some part of the wall should always be in plain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
color, as the eye requires rest; and no pattern, however subdued
in hue, can give the relief to the mind that a bit of plain
coloring affords, and this scarcity of ornament in one part of
a room is amply repaid by the effect it gives to such parts as
are bright and should be bright. The true theory of effect is
to use but one or two bright colors in a room, and to surround
them by soft and subdued tints that throw up and do
not destroy their brilliancy; a number of bright colors placed
together destroy each other, and leave no impression upon
the mind but glare and vulgarity. Having settled upon your
paper and ceiling, have the woodwork and cornice of the
room painted either a shade lighter or darker than the walls,
and shroud up the mantelpiece with curtains, etc., of satin
sheeting embroidered with crewels, and instead of the usual
looking glass over the fire-place, have a mirror surrounded
with brackets holding china; or have a black wooden
mantelpiece made with squares of looking glass set in. The
back-ground of your room being thus completed in a manner
really to be a back-ground, your furniture will look twice as
well as if it were stared out of countenance by the walls, and
one need hardly add that all your friends will delight in a
room that throws up and brings out their dresses and faces,
instead of killing them by its glaring tints.</p>

<p><b>Operations.</b>—To prepare the walls, make a size of glue
and water, then give the walls a coat of a very weak solution
of the same. To make a paste, take two pounds of fine
flour, put in a pail; add cold water, and stir it up together in
a thick paste. Take a piece of alum about the size of a
small chestnut, pound it fine and throw it into the paste;
mix well. Then provide about six quarts of boiling water
and mix while hot with the paste until the whole is brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
to a proper consistency. This makes an excellent paste, and
fit for use when cold.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning Paper-Hangings.</b>—A very good method to
clean paper-hangings is that used oftentimes in cleaning the
margins of prints. Cut into eight pieces a quartern loaf two
days old, and after having swept all the dust from the paper-hangings,
commence from the ceiling downward, and somewhat
lightly rub the paper with a downward stroke with one
of the pieces of bread. Continue this round the room, and
then commence lower down in the same way till the whole
of the surface of the paper has been gone over. The bread
will from time to time get dirty, and it should be cut off as
often as required. Care should be exercised not to rub the
paper with a cross or horizontal stroke, only with the perpendicular
movement of the hand or the paper may peel off
the walls from the joints. With careful manipulation, paper
will look almost as good as new.</p>

<p><b>Varnishing Paper-hangings.</b>—When papers are
hung in places where there is much passing, they are subject
to greater wear than in an ordinary room, and varnishing is
resorted to, to make them more durable, as it prevents soiling;
they may also be cleaned with a damp cloth, and are
not in wear so likely to be damaged by rubbing off the wall.
Halls, lobbies, staircases, and offices are sometimes varnished
for durability, but as a rule the appearance is not improved.
The paper must be sized twice, the first being dry before the
next is applied, when the varnish is laid evenly on. It is
necessary to size the paper twice, as the first time may not
effectually cover it, when the varnish would stain the paper as
badly as if oil had been applied. The size necessary for sizing
the paper before varnishing should be clean and transparent.
Parchment cuttings boiled down in water and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
strained will make excellent size for this purpose. Before it
is cold it should be either strained through calico, or poured
off, leaving the bits at the bottom. A patent size is sold for
this purpose, but parchment size is the most reliable. Use
clean brushes for size and varnish.</p>

<p><b>A Paste that will Keep Well.</b>—A correspondent
writes to a journal this formula for a non-poisonous paste that
will keep well in hot weather: Wheat flour, 1 ounce; powdered
alum, ¹⁄₂ drachm; water, sufficient, or 8 ounces; oil of
clove, or wintergreen, 3 or 4 drops. Rub the flour and the
alum with the water to the consistency of milk; place this
over a moderate fire, and stir constantly, until the paste drops
from the wooden paddle in jelly-like flakes, and has the
appearance of glycerite of starch. While the mass is still hot,
add the essential oil, and pour the paste into an earthenware
pot or open jar. In the course of about an hour a crust
forms on the top; pour gently on this an inch of water, more
or less. When some paste is wanted, decant the water, take
out the quantity needed, and put some water again on the
remainder, repeating the operation each time. Paste may be
kept in this way for months, and will never be troubled with
flies.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="USEFUL_HINTS_FOR_ESTIMATING_COST">USEFUL HINTS FOR ESTIMATING COST
OF WORK AND MATERIALS.</h2>
</div>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>All surface painting is measured by the superficial yard,
girting every part of the work covered, always making allowance
for the deep cuttings in mouldings, carved work, railings
or other work that is difficult to get at.</p>

<p>Where work is very high and scaffolding or ladders have
to be employed, allowances must be made.</p>

<p>The following rules are generally adopted in this country
in the measurement of work. Surfaces under six inches in
width or girt are called 6 inches; from six to 12 inches, 12
inches; over 12 inches measured superficial. Openings are
deducted, but all jambs, reveals or casings are measured
girt.</p>

<p>Sashes are measured solid if more than two lights. Doors,
shutters and paneling are measured by the girt, running the
tape in all quirks, angles or corners. Sash doors measure
solid. Glazing in both windows and doors is always extra.
The tape should be run close in over the battens, on batten
doors, and if the stuff is beaded, add one inch in width for
each bead.</p>

<p>Venetian blinds are measured double. Dentels, brackets,
medallions, ornamented iron work, balusters, lattice work,
palings or turned work should all be measured double.
Changing colors on base boards, panels, cornices, or other
work, one-fourth extra measurement should be allowed for
each tint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Add five per cent. to regular price for knotting, puttying,
cleaning and sand-papering.</p>

<p>For work done above the ground floor charge as follows:
Add five per cent. for each story of 12 feet or less, if interior
work; if exterior work, add one per cent. for each foot of
height above the first 12 feet.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give prices for painting that will be
reliable in any one section of this country for more than a
month, as the cost of materials and labor is continually varying,
but we offer the following hints, which may assist the
workman to make a fairly just estimate of work:</p>

<p>For plain colors on wood—</p>

<table class="thin">
<tr><td class="tdl">
First coat, per yard,</td><td class="tdr">
$—</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">
2 coats, add&#160;&#160;&#160;”</td><td class="tdr">4-5</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">
3 coats,&#160;&#160;&#160;”&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;”</td><td class="tdr">1¹⁄₂</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Now, by this rule, if the first coat was 10 cents, two coats
would be 18 cents, and three coats would be 25 cents. This
is a simple method and easily understood, and is adapted to
any sort of plain painting or graining.</p>

<p>Graining, with one or two coats of good varnish, is worth,
at this writing, from 65 cents to $2.00 per yard, and marbling
from $1.50 to $2.75 per yard.</p>

<p>Marbling mantels is worth from $5.00 to $20.00, according
to style of marble and beauty of finish. All of the above
prices are based on the understanding that the workman
furnishes all tools and materials.</p>
